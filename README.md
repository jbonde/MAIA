# MAIA - a MAritime Information Application

MAIA is a maritime information and utility tool to be installed on board as a supplement to plotters or mobile navigation devices in order to optimize overview of yacht data from instruments and GPS but also for providing additional information and features.

The software is targeted for small touch screens and all menus are designed with an intuitive user interface which enables quick and easy access to information during sailing through a simple layout that is visible everywhere in a standard cockpit.

As for using the system on smaller displays for Raspberry Pi's like PiTFT 3.5" or the official RPi 7" the amount of items in menus are kept to a minimum comprising 6 choices in a 3x2 matrix. All information displayed is primarily one value at a time, but there are also some options for condensed views if the user can read it on the current display. When data is displayed the screen works as a full size button and touching the screen will revert to the last menu.

When switching on the system a matrix menu presents 6 choices:
* Actions and information related to departure
* Overview of actual position
* Data related to the destination
* Dashboard that comprises most live data 
* MOB (Man Over Board) function
* Access to the sub menus

# Functionality
DEP (Departure) include Trip Start and Trip Stop functions. Other functions displays Distance Covered, Trip time, Average Speed and Max Speed. A digital log is automatically enabled when the trip is started so all data are saved at short intervals in a format that can be uploaded directly to Google Maps or used in spreadsheets for further analysis.

NOW shows information about actual Position such as GPS-Coordinates, Speed and Heading

DES (Destination) features a Waypoint selector/editor and shows distance/bearing to selected waypoint. There is also a time calculator showing estimated Time-To-Go and ETA.

DASH will take you to the dashboard which is coded in a "B&G" style with a left and right column showing live data from instruments. The center is a compass rose with four coloured lines representing COG, BRG, TWD and AWA. AWA will change color between red and green according to angle. Tapping the display will change the view from "North-up" to "Course-up".

The * (sub menu)  section gives access to the Timer- and Race modules and Weather data from the temperature, air pressure and humidity sensors as well as system information. Settings can also be reached from this section eg if you would like a layout with black background and dim the display during night passages.

For further insight to the general flow and sub-menus please check MAIA_functionality.png and the MAIA.png flowchart 

# Data acquisition
Data is picked up via UDP on a standard LAN either wired or wireless in order to service as many display configurations as desired on board. Instrument data are acquired and submitted from the MAIA server (see MAIAserver.py) or any other device capable of broadcasting standard NMEA-strings via UDP. For full data feed the MAIAserver with weather sensors is required.

# Testing
The MAIA application can be tested by running MAIAsimulator.py on a separate RPi connected to same LAN. This will take you on a virtual but realistic trip around the Danish island Anholt in a fairly stable westerly breeze. If you at the same time as launching the simulator will start a trip in MAIA you can after 6 hours fetch the CSV-file and upload the tour to Google maps for testing the log data that was recorded (check MAIA_simulator.png). You are impatient you are also welcome to alter the data in the simulator in order to make a faster trip.

# Disclaimer
MAIA should never be used as the primary navigation tool. It is a supplement to proven products on the market and some features still need to be tested in live environments. So use of the system is by own responsibility and developers have no liabilities for any errors and problems occurred by the MAIA system.
